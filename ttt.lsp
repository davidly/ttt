; Prove you can't win at tic-tac-toe if the opponent is competent.
; Tested with PC-LISP V3.00. Likely won't work with more modern LISP implementations.
; This takes roughly half an hour to run on a 4.77Mhz 8088.
; This runs in about 3.4 seconds in the NTVDM emulator on an AMD 5950x
; I am not proficient in LISP; there are likely easy ways to improve performance.
; More recent versions of LISP have helpful functions including:
;    /= not equal
;    bitwise operators like logand
;    byte datatype instead of 4-byte integers
; But Common LISP doesn't seem to have hunks.
